        <p>If you have never made Empanadas de Plátano Maduro stuffed with cheese, promise me you will give them a try soon! These
            empanadas are versatile and can be made both savory or sweet. For those wanting a more sweet dish, try adding guava paste as the filling.
            The combination of cheese and guava is divine!

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>

            <li>4 sweet plantains</li>
            <li>8 cups of water</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li> 1 cup mozzarella cheese (or other cheese of your preference), grated </li>
            <li>2-3 cups vegetable oil to fry</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Directions</h5>

        <ol>
        <li>Wash and cut the plantains in half. Boil them with the skin at medium heat in a large pot with 8 cups of water and salt to taste, until plantains are completely cooked and soft, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Peel and mash cooked plantains with fork until you get a purée. Let cool.</li>

        <li>Stir in egg, flour, vanilla and mix well. Put it in the refrigerator for half an hour. Form 12 balls with the dough, press down, and make them round with the palm of your hand.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese, fold it in half and press a bit around, so the cheese is sealed and it does not melt out.</li>
