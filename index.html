        <h2>Empanadas with Cheese Recipe</h2>
        <p>If you have never made Empanadas de Platano Maduro stuffed with cheese, promise me you will give them a try soon! These
            empanadas are versatile and can be made both savory or sweet. For those wanting a more sweet dish, try adding guava paste as the filling.
            The combination of cheese and guava is divine!

        <br>
        <li>Stir in egg, flour, vanilla and mix well. Put it in the refrigerator for half an hour. Form 12 balls with the dough, press down, and make them round with the palm of your hand.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the cheese, fold it in half and press a bit around, so the cheese is sealed and it does not melt out.</li>
